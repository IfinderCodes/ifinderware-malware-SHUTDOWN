# ifinderware-malware-

If you download and run this i am not responsible for the damage it does.

This is not meant for malicious purposes.
I am in no means responsible for dealing the damage so it gets used for.
So educational purposes i guess. Dont use it on your main workstation.
If you ran this on a scammer or you're the scammer that ran it then you / they deserved it.
Still not responsible tho. DONT FUCKEN USE MY MALWARE FOR MALICIOUS STUFF OKAY?
